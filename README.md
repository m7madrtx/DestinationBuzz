# 📍 DestinationBuzz
A location-aware alarm app that wakes you up as you near your destination — perfect for naps or movies on long bus &amp; train rides.

## 🚀 Features
- Works without internet 🛜
- Set your destination, sleep peacefully 😴
- Alerts you when you're close 🚨
- More features to come in future updates 😊

## 🛠️ How It Works
The app uses your device's GPS to track your location's coordinates & updates the distance remaining against your set destination. Once within a defined range, it triggers an alarm.

## 🫤 Limitations
1. Cannot save alarm settings or locations to Favourites (yet).
2. Inability to obtain destination coordinates within the app due to lack of map UI.
3. Currently works on Android only (I think that a MacBook is needed to optimize & test the app on iOS via XCode, but uh... I don't have a MacBook 😅).

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Run with Flutter:
   ```bash
   flutter run

## 🗒️ Note
1. Destination coordinates can be obtained from Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap.org, etc.
2. I'm not quite familiar with the intricacies of GitHub, so any advice on how to improve this repository / project will be closely listened to.
3. I'm also a novice Dart developer, so this app isn't built perfectly. That said, any contribution towards the development of this application would be fantastic.
