# 📍 DestinationBuzz
A location-aware alarm app that wakes you up as you near your destination — perfect for naps or movies on long bus &amp; train rides.

## 🚀 Features
- Works without internet 🛜
- Set your destination, sleep peacefully 😴
- Alerts you when you're close 🚨
- More features to come in future updates 😊

## 🛠️ How It Works
The app uses your device's GPS to track your location's coordinates & updates the distance remaining against your set destination. Once within a defined range, it triggers an alarm.

1. Turn on Location & open Google Maps (or any map application of choice).
2. In case of Google Maps, tap & hold on the location on the map to reveal drop a pin & reveal the coordinates.
3. Tap the coordinates to copy them.
4. (Optional) Turn off WiFi / LTE.
5. Ensure volume is at least 50% to hear the alarm.
6. Launch the app & accept the permissions, when prompted.
7. Paste your destination coordinates in the allocated field.
8. (Optional) Choose an alarm sound & set the remaining distance for the alarm to trigger.
9. Switching to another app or turning off the screen causes the app to run in the background.
10. To close the app once the alarm rings, you can either (1) swipe away the app from the recents screen, (2) press the power button in the app, or (3) press back twice to exit.

## 🫤 Current Limitations
1. No vibration implementation: The app won't vibrate once the alarm is triggered upon imminent arrival to destination.
2. No persistence: User cannot save alarm settings or destinations to Favourites.
3. No map UI: The app lacks a map-like interface for the user to search for & pick a destination.
4. No iOS version: This Flutter app is, for now, built for Android. Since I don't own an iPhone or a MacBook (XCode), I'm unable to optimize & test the app on iOS.

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Run with Flutter:
   ```bash

## 🗒️ Note
1. Destination coordinates can be obtained from Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap.org, etc.
2. I'm not quite familiar with the intricacies of GitHub, so any advice on how to improve this repository / project will be closely listened to.
3. I'm also new to programming in Dart, so this app isn't put together brilliantly. That said, any contribution towards the development of this application would be fantastic.
