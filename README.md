# 📍 DestinationBuzz
A location-aware alarm app that wakes you up as you near your destination — perfect for naps or movies on long bus &amp; train rides.

## 🚀 Features
- Works without internet 🛜
- Set your destination, sleep peacefully 😴
- Alerts you when you're close 🚨
- More features to come in future updates 😊

## 🛠️ How It Works
The app uses your device's GPS to track your location's coordinates & updates the distance remaining against your set destination. Once within a defined range, it triggers an alarm.

## 🫤 Current Limitations
1. No persistence: User cannot save alarm settings or destinations to Favourites.
2. No map UI: The app lacks a map-like interface for the user to search for & pick a destination.
3. No iOS version: This Flutter app is, for now, built for Android. Since I don't own an iPhone or a MacBook (XCode), I'm unable to optimize & test the app on iOS.

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Run with Flutter:
   ```bash
   flutter run

## 🗒️ Note
1. Destination coordinates can be obtained from Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap.org, etc.
2. I'm not quite familiar with the intricacies of GitHub, so any advice on how to improve this repository / project will be closely listened to.
3. I'm also new to programming in Dart, so this app isn't put together brilliantly. That said, any contribution towards the development of this application would be fantastic.
